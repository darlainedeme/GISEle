Initialization and Imports:

Imported necessary libraries for geospatial analysis, visualization, and Streamlit functionality.
Included libraries such as streamlit, folium, geopandas, numpy, osmnx, earthengine-api, etc.
Earth Engine Authentication:

Read credentials from Streamlit secrets and authenticated with Google Earth Engine (EE) API using a service account.
Streamlit Configuration:

Set up the Streamlit app layout to be wide.
Defined sidebar navigation options and a title for the app.
Mode Selection:

Provided options in the sidebar for users to select a mode for specifying the area of interest (by address, coordinates, or uploading a file).
Map Creation Function:

Defined a function to create and display a Folium map with various layers (e.g., Google Maps, Google Hybrid, Esri Satellite).
Added functionalities to display the uploaded area, roads, buildings, points of interest (POIs), and nighttime lights data.
File Upload Handling:

Allowed users to upload GIS files (e.g., GeoJSON, KML, GPKG).
Read the uploaded file into a GeoDataFrame and processed it accordingly.
Address and Coordinates Handling:

Provided input fields for users to enter an address or coordinates.
Geocoded the address or used the coordinates to center and display the map.
OSM and Google Buildings Data:

Based on the selected mode, fetched and displayed OpenStreetMap (OSM) or Google buildings data within the area of interest.
Nighttime Lights Data:

Integrated with Microsoft’s Planetary Computer to fetch nighttime lights data for the specified area.
GeoDataFrame to Map:

Added various features to the map (e.g., selected area, roads, buildings, POIs) based on the processed GeoDataFrame and other data sources.
Interactive Map Controls:

Included controls for drawing, full-screen view, and measuring distances on the map.
Sidebar Information:

Provided additional information and contact details in the sidebar.
Caching:

Used Streamlit’s caching mechanism to optimize data loading and processing.
