        ### 2.1. Area Selection
        This step allows you to define your area of interest. You can select the area by entering an address, using coordinates, or uploading a GeoJSON file that represents the region you're focusing on.

        ### 2.2. Satellite Timelapse
        Generate and visualize satellite timelapse for your selected area, giving you insight into changes over time within the region.
        """)

        st.markdown("""
        ### 3.1. Data Retrieve
        In this step, you'll download all the necessary datasets for your selected area. The datasets include information about buildings, roads, points of interest, and more. You'll be able to monitor the download progress and save the results.

        ### 3.2. Data Visualization and Enhancement
        After retrieving the data, visualize the datasets on a map. This section also allows you to manually enhance the datasets by adding or modifying features directly on the map.

        ### 3.3. VANIA Report
        Generate comprehensive reports based on the visualized and enhanced data. These reports are crucial for in-depth analysis and decision-making.

        ### 4.1. Modelling Parameters
        Define various input parameters required for your analysis, including cost inputs, demand estimation assumptions, and other key factors that influence your GIS project.

        ### 4.2. Clustering
        Perform clustering analysis to identify significant patterns and groupings within the target area. This helps in understanding the distribution of various features and optimizing resources.

        ### 4.3. Demand Estimation
        Estimate the energy demand within your area of interest using different methodologies. This step is essential for planning energy distribution and infrastructure.

        ### 4.4. Mini-grid Sizing
        Based on the estimated demand, optimize the design and size of mini-grids to ensure efficient energy distribution.

        ### 4.5. Routing
        Plan the optimal routes for infrastructure such as roads, power lines, and pipelines, taking into account the geographical features and the existing infrastructure.

        ### 4.6. Results
        View and download the final results of your analysis, including maps, charts, and detailed reports that summarize all the steps and findings of your GIS project.
